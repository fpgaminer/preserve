summary: Encrypted backup system
description: |
  Preserve is an encrypted backup system written in Rust. All backup data is
  encrypted, so backups can be stored on untrusted devices/services without
  exposing any of your data. Backups are simple, operating very similar to
  creating an archive like Zip or Tar. Deduplication makes this space efficient.
